2.  Lossless and lossy compression are terms that describe whether or not,
in the compression of a file, all original data can be recovered when the file
is uncompressed. With lossless compression, every single bit of data that was
originally in the file remains after the file is uncompressed.

4.    1. The system modifies the filename's first character to signal that it has
       been deleted and that the directory entry can be recycled.
       (Most OSs simply remove the file's reference from the containing dir.)
    2. The system moves all of the file's FAT clusters to the hard drive's list
       of free clusters.
The file's data is never touched.
5.  Write NUL bytes (or random characters) to every address on the disk.
There's consensus that "overwriting a disk with a few random passes" is
